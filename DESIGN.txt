Moved viewportToWorld() and worldToViewport() to Viewport class because of Viewport object in parameter
Moved shift() and contains() to Viewport class because they used many Viewport objects
Moved getImageList() and loadImages() to ImageStore class because they use many ImageStore objects
Moved processImageLine() and getImages() to ImageStore class because they use a map identical to an instance field in that class
Moved setAlpha() to ImageStore class because it is only called in another ImageStore function
Moved COLOR_MASK, KEYED_IMAGE_MIN, KEYED_RED_IDX, KEYED_GREEN_IDX, and KEYED_BLUE_IDX to ImageStore class because of multiple usages in that class
Moved getAnimationPeriod() and nextImage() to Entity class because the only parameter is an Entity object
Moved drawBackground(), drawEntities(), and drawViewport() to WorldView class because the only parameter is a WorldView object
Moved shiftView() into WorldView class because it has a WorldView object in parameter
Moved executeAction(), executeAnimationAction(), and executeActivityAction() to Action class because they use many Action objects
Moved updateOnTime(), removePendingEvent(), unscheduleAllEvents(), and scheduleEvent() because they use many EventScheduler objects
Moved getBackgroundImage(), getBackgroundCell(), setBackgroundCell(), withinBounds(), isOccupied(), getOccupant(), getOccupancyCell(),
setOccupancyCell(), and removeEntityAt() to WorldModel class because they compare a WorldModel object with a Point object
Moved all "parse" files to WorldModel class because they are all mainly comprised of WorldModel objects
Moved tryAddEntity(), addEntity(), moveEntity(), removeEntity(), and load() to WorldModel class because they used many WorldModel objects
Moved SAPLING, DUDE, FAIRY, TREE, OBSTACLE, HOUSE, and STUMP constants to WorldModel class because they are used many times many times in the class
Moved scheduleActions() and all "execute" and "transform" methods to Entity class because they are mainly comprised of Entity objects
Moved createAnimationAction(), createActivityAction(), createDudeFull(), createStump(), createTree(), createSapling(), and createDudeNotFull(),
getIntFromRange(), and getNumFromRange() to Entity class because most usages of the method occur in that class
Moved TREE and SAPLING constants to Entity class because they are only used in that class
Moved createFairy(), createObstacle(), and createHouse() to WorldModel class because those methods are only used in that class
Moved tryAddEntity(), findNearest(), nearestEntity(), distanceSquared(), and getCurrentImage() to WorldModel class because they are called in that class
Moved moveToFairy(), moveToNotFull(), moveToFull(), nextPositionFairy(), and nextPositionDude() to Entity class because they mainly used
Entity objects and they were called many times in that class
Moved adjacent() to Entity class because it is only used in that class
For the methods that occur in multiple classes, I chose the class it occurs in most and kept it static to make it available to other classes
